### Installing Android Studio

To install Android studio please refer to the official Android docs instruction: https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio

## Step 1

* Start a new Android Project

* Give it a name and a Domain (the domain is a unique identifier that is used by the PlayStore when a app is published)
    * Your domain should be: com.lastName.appName

* Here we can select the API Level of our app and the different form factors. We can keep the way it is and click next.

* For this app we will be using the template with a blank activity. This will take generate a good amount of code for us and give the structure we need for our app.
