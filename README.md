# MagicBall
Magic Ball has the answer for that doubtul question you have in mind!

Magic Ball is a simple small application developed to be used as a codelab to teach Android to beginners. 
The sample code is relative easy to follow and the goal of the tutorial is to have a usable App for the students without the need
of any data persistance layer or network connections. 

The tutorial link will be published here September 10th after the codelab is done by GDG OSU Stillwater.
